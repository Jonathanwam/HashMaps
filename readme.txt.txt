This is a simple HashMap implementation without using Java's built in hash functions
done for CS122 Data Structures at Washington State University - Vancouver.

A text file can be inputted through MyMap's main function so when ran, each word will 
be inserted into a hashmap. Each consecutive word increases its corresponding node's 
value by 1 thus creating a word count hashmap.
